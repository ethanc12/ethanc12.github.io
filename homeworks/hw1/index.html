        <p><em> Data Science Major | 2nd year</em></p>
        <p>Things I like to do are play sports, eat, sleep, and do group activities. I like to play volleyball, basketball, and golf.
            I like most foods but I do enjoy eating meat and have a sweet tooth. 
            I love to sleep in but also like to be awake to enjoy the full day.
            I enjoy being around people and so doing puzzles, board games, going out are things that make me happy.

            <li>1: Something I learned from this article is that you don't have to be a "naturally skilled" designer to design well.
                The trick is to be keen to all the singular components and their purpose, which, add together to create one.

                 2: My favorite part of this article is that it is thorough in explaning each subcomponent.
                 The author points out a specific part we want to look at based on the visual also provided which allows for convenient learning.
