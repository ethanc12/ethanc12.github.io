					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<p> This is the New York Times Mini Crossword Website Wireframe</p>
							<img src = "assets\imgs\IMG_5308.JPG" />
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>
							<p> This is my redesigned wireframe of it </p>
							<img src = "assets\imgs\IMG_5309.JPG"/>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p> The goal of the website is to provide users a place where they can casually complete a mini crossword. 
								The site is intended for anyone who is interested in taking a little bit of their time and challenge themselves to completing the clues as fast as they can.
								The design accomplishes this by being simplistic and focusing in on the crossword itself that is in the middle of webpage.
						  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p> The original website was pretty minimalistic which made it looked clean but I felt that it may have looked a little boring.
								My redesign simply kept most of the formatting but rearranged the clues for "down" and "across" so that they were actually formatted in that way.
								It was more so a stylistic edit than a problem fix. </p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>
