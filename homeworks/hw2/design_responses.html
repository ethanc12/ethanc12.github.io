							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that it is not a bad thing to have more white space but actually beneficial. 
								It helps readability, organization, and maintains focus on what the author is trying to point out. 
								With more white space, it acts as a breath of fresh air and is visually more appealing than overcrowding.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I liked how they organized their points to bolster their claim that white space is good. 
								They structured it so that at first it told a slight story about their engineers and how they are nitpicky with the advice they give.
								Then it transitions into the three main points which I enjoyed reading.
								And lastly refuted the idea that people won't scroll if there is too much space.
