						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Color accessibility is extremely important and there are a variety of ways to make your website more accessible to everyone. 
								One way is to focus on the contrast of items so that they stand out better and no one gets left behind/ misses out on anything important.
								Another is accommodating for the visually impaired.
								Lastly, you can use standard color systems that have been researched and proven to be effectively to help out with this.

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was when they showed the two different contrasts of what to do and what not.
								I found that helpful and also fun to see the differences in pictures. 
								After spotting the difference then was I able to see that one was clearly better than the other because otherwise, I don't think I would have caught it. </p>
